# Perform BLAST search

Perform a BLAST search with the photosynthesis genes (query) on the GOS blastable database.

The running script `runblast.py` uses the `num_threads` option and it is set to `3`. This is to create 2 worker threads (to use the two cores in my processor) and 1 main thread. You might want to change this parameter to suit your system.
